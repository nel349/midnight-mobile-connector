## üí° **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Build on Existing Foundation**
- Extend current walletManager.ts for transaction features
- Use existing midnightProviders.ts for balance/transaction queries
- Enhance MultiWalletManager.tsx with send/receive UI
- Leverage existing test infrastructure for new features

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Implement features incrementally with testing at each step
- Use existing proven network infrastructure
- Maintain backward compatibility with current wallet data
- Plan rollback strategies for each major feature
