# Midnight Mobile Wallet Development Plan

## 🎯 **Project Goal**
Build a privacy-first mobile wallet for Midnight Network that runs all cryptographic operations locally on-device using WebAssembly.

## ✅ **Phase 0: Foundation (COMPLETED)**
- [x] **WASM Loading**: Successfully load 1.6MB Midnight WASM module in React Native WebView
- [x] **JavaScript Glue**: Transform and execute 74KB wasm-bindgen generated code  
- [x] **WebAssembly Instantiation**: 166 WASM functions + 146 JS functions available
- [x] **Privacy Architecture**: No remote servers - all operations on-device

**Result**: Working foundation for mobile WASM execution (see `WASM_MOBILE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Core Wallet Functions**

### **Objectives**
Prove that Midnight's core cryptographic functions work on mobile and create a developer-friendly API.

### **Tasks**
1. **Test Midnight Core Functions**
   - [ ] Key generation (`generateKeys()`, seed phrases)
   - [ ] Address derivation (public + private addresses)
   - [ ] Balance queries (`getBalance()`)
   - [ ] Transaction building (`buildTransaction()`)
   - [ ] Zero-knowledge proof generation (`generateProof()`)
   - [ ] Transaction signing and verification

2. **Create Mobile API Wrapper**
   - [ ] Design clean React Native interface
   - [ ] Handle async operations properly
   - [ ] Add error handling and validation
   - [ ] Create TypeScript types/interfaces
   - [ ] Add logging and debugging utilities

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Unit tests for each core function
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks (key gen, proof time, etc.)
   - [ ] Memory usage analysis
   - [ ] Error scenario testing

### **Deliverables**
- `MidnightWallet.ts` - Core wallet class
- `types/` - TypeScript definitions
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `examples/` - Usage examples

### **Success Criteria**
- Generate valid Midnight key pairs on mobile
- Build and sign valid Midnight transactions
- Generate zero-knowledge proofs locally
- All operations complete in reasonable time (<5s)

4. **Privacy Features**
   - [ ] Private vs public balance display
   - [ ] Shield/unshield operations
   - [ ] Privacy-preserving transaction options
   - [ ] Zero-knowledge proof status

### **Deliverables**
- Complete React Native wallet app
- Reusable UI components

   - [ ] Block header syncing
   - [ ] Transaction filtering (user's transactions only)
   - [ ] Merkle proof verification
   - [ ] Offline mode handling

3. **Real Data Integration**
   - [ ] Live balance updates
   - [ ] Transaction status tracking
   - [ ] Network fee estimation
   - [ ] Historical transaction data
   - [ ] Asset metadata and pricing

### **Deliverables**
